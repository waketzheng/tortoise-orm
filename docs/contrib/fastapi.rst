Tortoise-ORM FastAPI integration
================================

We have a lightweight integration util ``tortoise.contrib.fastapi`` which has a class ``RegisterTortoise`` that sets up/cleans up Tortoise-ORM in lifespan function.

FastAPI is basically Starlette & Pydantic, but in a very specific way.


See the :ref:`example_fastapi` & have a look at the :ref:`contrib_pydantic` tutorials.
